# Stream Extraction from Digital Elevation Models
# Automating Flow Accumulation Thresholds for Extracting Stream Networks from Digital Elevation Models

In the first year of my Ph.D. work, I wrote an NSF proposal on the topic of the accurate identification of headwaters. This proposal aimed to automate the process of stream networks extraction from DEMs by incorporating terrain derivatives and landscape characteristics into flow accumulation threshold selection procedure. Previous work has examined the effects of terrain derivatives and landscape characteristics on stream formation and flow accumulation thresholds, but none have completely been effective in taking the spatial variability of terrain into account to choose an appropriate threshold. To date, the proper method to choose the appropriate threshold is still undefined. I stopped working on this project, because I could not find a scientific method to assess the results of the proposed methods. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is widely used; however, these datasets underestimate and do not reflect a substantial portion of headwaters.
